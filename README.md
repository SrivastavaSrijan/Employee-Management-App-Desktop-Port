# employee-management-app-desktop
A simple JavaFX app to add,edit and delete employee.
This is a standalone desktop application.

 This application to generate values for employees from a database seamlessly and randomly, add said employee's details to a database (DerbyDB for Windows) and display said employees in a table with the option to search, sort or edit details.

This application was developed using JavaFX and SceneBuilder. I used JavaFaker to display random values for employees. I used JPhoenix for material design.
