# employee-management-app-desktop
A simple JavaFX app to add,edit and delete employee.
 It's a standalone desktop application.
This application to generate values for employees from a database seamlessly and randomly, add said employee's details to a database (DerbyDB for Windows) and display said employees in a table with the option to search, sort or edit details.
This application was developed using JavaFX and SceneBuilder. I used JavaFaker to display random values for employees. I used jfoenix for material design. For icons, I used FontAwesomeFX. This was built on OpenJavaFX11. 
For packaging, I used jmod to create a JavaFX runtime libraries, and jlink to link the apps to these modules. Because of this, I was able to run the application in any environment
